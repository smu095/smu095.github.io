This week's [Riddler Express](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-your-best-scrabble-string/) poses the presents the following probability problem:

> You have two buckets and 100 ping-pong balls, 50 of which are red and 50 of which are blue. You get to arrange the balls into the two buckets however youâ€™d like, but each bucket needs at least one ball. Your friend will blindly choose one of the two buckets and then select a ball at random from the chosen bucket. 
>
> How can you arrange the balls to maximize the probability that your friend chooses a red ball? What probability of success do you achieve?
>
> *Extra credit*: What probability of success do you get with 25 balls of each color? 200 balls of each color?

Usually I try to solve these problems by [coding up](https://smu095.github.io/2019/04/12/2019-04-12-theriddler-simulating-spelling-bees/) [a solution](https://smu095.github.io/2019/04/16/2019-04-12-theriddler-coffee-cards-and-credit/) in Python, which is usually really good practice. Sometimes, however, it's nice to try to take an analytical approach as well. So I though I'd write up one possible solution suggestion for this week's problem.

Consider two buckets, $A$ and $B$. Let the probability of drawing a red ball from bucket $A$ be denoted 

$$p_1 = p(red \vert A) = \dfrac{x_1}{x_1 + y_1},$$

where $x_1$ denotes the number of red balls and $y_1$ denotes the number of blue balls. Hopefully this makes sense. The probability of drawing a red ball is the number of red balls in bucket $A$ divided by the total number of balls in bucket $A$.

Let the probability of drawing a red ball from bucket $B$ be denoted

$$p_2 = p(red \vert B) = \dfrac{x_2}{x_2 + y_2}.$$

Again, $x_2$ denotes the number of red balls and $y_2$ denotes the number of blue balls. The probability of drawing a red ball is the number of red balls in bucket $B$ divided by the total number of balls in bucket $B$.

### Finding an upper bound

The puzzle asks us to maximise the probability of drawing a red ball, given that we choose a bucket at random. This can be expressed as

$$p(red) = 0.5p_1 + 0.5p_2$$.

This also makes sense, right? If we choose a bucket at random, we have a 50-50 chance of selecting either bucket $A$ or $B$. The probability of selecting urn $A$ is 50%, and the probability of drawing a red ball from urn $A$ is given by $p_1$. Likewise, the probability of selecting urn $B$ is 50%, and the probability of selecting a red ball from urn $B$ is given by $p_2$. Our job is now to maximise $p(red)$. 

First, consider urn $A$. Which combination $(x_1, y_1)$ maximises $p_1$? Well, it seems obvious that if we set $y_1 = 0$,  then there are noe blue balls in urn $A$. Consequently, all the balls in this urn will be red. In other words, any value of $x_1$ will yield $p_1 = 1$. In fact, setting $y_1 = 0$ is the *only* way to get $p_1 = 1$. Too see this, fix $x_1$ at any value between 1 and 50 (because there always has to be *at least* one ball in the urn) and try adjusting $y_1$.

Setting $y_1 = 0$ seems like a good place to start. Again, remember that $x_1 \in [1, 50]$. There has to be *at least* one ball and *at most* 50 in urn $A$.

Now consider urn $B$. If there are more red balls in urn $A$ than in urn $B$, then $x_2 < y_2$. In plain english, there will be more blue balls than red balls in urn $B$. Another way of writing this is $x_2 + 1 \leq y_2$. This reformulation is important because it gives us an expression for the upper bound of $p_2$, the maximum value it can take.  The upper bound is obtained by substituting the inequality into our expression for $p_2$,

$$p_2 = \dfrac{x_2}{x_2 + y_2} \leq \dfrac{x_2}{x_2 + x_2 + 1} = \dfrac{x_2}{2x_2 + 1}.$$

### Locating the maximum

What else do we know about $x_2$? Well, since we have 50 red balls, we know that the number of red balls in urn $B$ is the total number of red balls minus the number of red balls in urn $A$,

$$x_2 = 50 - x_1, \text{ where } x_1 \in [1, 50].$$

Again, substituting this into $p_2$ yields

$$p_2 \leq \dfrac{50-x_1}{2(50 - x_1) + 1} = \dfrac{50-x_1}{101 - 2 x_1}.$$

This tells us that the upper bound of $p_2$ is given by $(50 - x_1) / (101 - 2x_1)$.

Since $p_1$ is always 1 when $y_1 = 0$, our main concern is to find the value of $x_1$ that maximises $p_2$. We can plot these probabilities with the following code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def p2(x1):
  	"""Probability of drawing a red ball from urn B given number of balls in urn A."""
    return (50 - x1) / (101 - 2*x1)

# Number of balls in urn A 
x1 = np.arange(1, 51)

# Plotting probabilities
plt.plot(x1, p2(x1))
plt.xlabel("number of red balls in urn A")
plt.ylabel("p(red | urn B)")
plt.title("Drawing red balls from urn B")
plt.show()
```

From the figure, it seems that $p_2$ is maximised when $x_1 = 1$. We can confirm this by analysing the derivative of the upper bound of $p_2$ (denoted $\tilde{p}_2$) with respect to $x_1$,

$$\dfrac{d\tilde{p}_2}{d x_1} = \dfrac{d}{dx_1} \Bigg(\dfrac{50-x_1}{101 - 2 x_1}\Bigg) = \dfrac{-1}{(101 - 2 x_1)^2}.$$

Note that $d\tilde{p}_2/d x_1 < 0$ for all $x_1 \in [1, 50]$. Since the derivative is always negative, $\tilde{p}_2$ is monotonically decreasing when $x_1 \in [1, 50]$. And since $\tilde{p}_2$ is the largest value $p_2$ can take, the probability of drawing a red ball given that you choose urn $B$ is indeed maximised when $x_1 = 1$. Strictly speaking, we could reach the same conclusion without reparameterising $p_2$ in terms of $x_1$, but I find this approach slightly more intuitive.

### Putting it all together

To calculate the probability of drawing a red ball when selecting an urn at random, we simply plug in $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 50 - x_1 = 50 - 1 = 49$ into our expression for $p(red)$:

$$p(red) = 0.5\dfrac{1}{1} + 0.5\dfrac{49}{99} = 0.7474$$.

In other words, to maximise the probability of drawing a red ball when an urn is chosen at random, one of the urns should contain a single red ball, and the other should contain the rest.

There are probably many ways to implement a pure Python solution to this problem. One approach is the following:

```python
import itertools as it

def p(num_red, num_blue, urn_prob=0.5, total_balls=100, red_balls=50):
    """Calculate probability of drawing a red ball after selecting an urn at random."""
    p1 = num_red / (num_red + num_blue)
    p2 = (red_balls - num_red) / (total_balls - num_red - num_blue)
    return urn_prob*p1 + (1 - urn_prob)*p2

def print_results(results):
    """Calculate and print results of maximising p(red)"""
    max_prob = max(results.values())
    num_red, num_blue = max(results, key=results.get)
    print(f"Probability of selecting red ball: {max_prob}")
    print(f"One of the urns must contain {num_red} red balls and {num_blue} blue balls.")

# Find find number of balls that maximise probability of drawing a red from a random urn
x1 = y1 = range(1, 51)
balls = it.product(x1, y1)
results = {(red, blue): p(red, blue) for red, blue in balls if (red + blue) != 100}

# Probability of selecting red ball: 0.7474747474747475
# One of the urns must contain 49 red balls and 50 blue balls.
print_results(results)
```

For extra credit, we can find the combination of colours that maximise the probability of drawing a red ball from a random urn when the when we have 25 and 200 of each colour, respectively:

```python
# 25 of each colour
N = 25
x1 = y1 = range(1, N + 1)
balls = it.product(x1, y1)

twentyfive = {
    (red, blue): p(red, blue, red_balls=N, total_balls=2*N) 
    for red, blue in balls 
    if (red + blue) != 2*N
}

# Probability of selecting red ball: 0.7448979591836735
# One of the urns must contain 24 red and 25 blue.
print_results(twentyfive)

# ---------------------------------------------------------

# 200 of each colour
N = 200
x1 = y1 = range(1, N + 1)
balls = it.product(x1, y1)

results = {
    (red, blue): p(red, blue, red_balls=N, total_balls=2*N) 
    for red, blue in balls 
    if (red + blue) != 2*N
}

# Probability of selecting red ball: 0.7493734335839599
# One of the urns must contain 199 red and 200 blue.
print_results(results)
```

That's it, hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!
