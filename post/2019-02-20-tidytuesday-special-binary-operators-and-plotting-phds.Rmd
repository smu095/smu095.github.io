If you're familiar with the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), you're most likely familiar with the pipe operator `%>%` from [**magrittr**](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/). The pipe operators

> pipe their left-hand side values forward into expressions that appear on the right-hand side, i.e. one can replace `f(x)` with `x %>% f()`, where `%>%` is the (main) pipe-operator ([https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/)).

`%>%` is an example of a [special binary operator](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html#Operators). Now, what's cool about special binary operators is that we can define our own! I learned about this on Twitter the other day, but unfortunately I forgot to like the tweet and consequently can't give credit where credit's due. I will, however, shamelessly steal the idea for [this week's #tidytuesday data set](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-02-19) which chronicles awarded PhDs in the US from 2008-2017.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Importing packages
library(tidyverse)

# Loading data
DIR <- "~/Documents/GitHub/tidytuesday/data/2019/2019-02-19"
csvs <- list.files(DIR, pattern = "*.csv")
data <- read_csv(file.path(DIR, csvs))
```


# Creating custom operators

The goal for this week is to write a function that takes a tibble and a function as arguments, and have it return a plot where the name of the function is used in the subtitle and legend. 

We start by defining our special binary operator:

```{r}
# Custom special binary operator
`%p%` <- function(lhs, rhs) return(paste0(lhs, rhs))
```

`%p%` will concatenate the left-hand string with the right-hand string. Like the pipe operator, `%p%` essentially lets us "pipe" the previously concatenated string into the next, creating a cascade of concatenations which results in a single string.

```{r}
# Example
string <- "Using %p% we can " %p% 
  "concatenate strings " %p% 
  "a la piping in dplyr!"

print(string)
```

Pretty neat! The next step is to somehow get a string representation of the name of a function. After some searching, [this post on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1567718/getting-a-function-name-as-a-string) offered one possible solution that uses the functions `deparse` and `substitute`:

```{r}
whacky_function_name <- function(x){
  return("#tidytuesday is fun!")
}

function2string <- deparse(substitute(whacky_function_name))
print(function2string)
```

# Plotting PhDs

Now we just need to put the pieces together. I'm aiming for a [diverging bars plot](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html#Diverging%20Bars) in the style of [**bbplot**](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot). Specifically, I'd like to make one that shows the number of PhDs awarded with respect to the average, and one with respect to the median. Here's one possible approach:

```{r}
# Plotting function
plot_phds <- function(df, f) {
  
  # Getting string representation of function
  f2string <- deparse(substitute(f)) 
  subtitle <- "Number of PhDs awarded relative to " %p% f2string %p% " (2008-2017)"
  
  # Counting number of PhDs, reordering
  data <- df %>% 
    count(major_field, wt = n_phds) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    mutate(diff = n - f(n), # Computing difference from mean
           major_field = fct_reorder(major_field, diff)) 
  
  # Getting annotation
  annot <- "US " %p% f2string %p% " = " %p% as.character(f(data$n))
  
  # Creating diverging bars plot
  data %>% 
    ggplot(aes(major_field, diff, fill = ifelse(sign(diff) > 0, "olivegreen", "firebrickred"))) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
    labs(title = "What's up Doc?", subtitle = subtitle) +
    scale_fill_discrete(label = c("Below " %p% f2string, "Above " %p% f2string)) +
    geom_curve(aes(x = "Teaching fields", y = 10000,
                 xend = "Economics", yend = 1000),
             size=0.5, curvature = 0.5,
             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.03, "npc"))) +
    annotate(geom = "label", x = "Teaching fields", y = 16000, label = annot, size = 5) +
    coord_flip() +
    bbplot::bbc_style() +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
          panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color="#cbcbcb"),
          legend.justification = "left")
}
```

Now we just need to call the function with the appropriate arguments, and we're done!

```{r eval=FALSE}
source_str <- "Source: National Science Foundation"
p1 <- plot_phds(data, mean)
bbplot::finalise_plot(p1, source = source_str,
                      save_filepath = "p1.png",
                      height = 600, width = 800,
                      logo_image_path = "logo.png")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
p2 <- plot_phds(data, median)
bbplot::finalise_plot(p2, source = source_str,
                      save_filepath = "p2.png",
                      height = 600, width = 800,
                      logo_image_path = "logo.png")
```

That's it for this week, hope you enjoyed it. As usual, [feedback](https://twitter.com/mattemagisk) is always welcome!
