This week was my [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) debut! Tidy Tuesday is a weekly data project which is aimed at R users who want to practice their wrangling and visualisation skills within the `tidyverse`. [This week's data set](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-01-15) features a historical record of rocket launches, and formed the basis for the article ["The space race is dominated by new contenders"](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/10/18/the-space-race-is-dominated-by-new-contenders).

My goals for this week were to:

* Expose myself to `gganimate`, a really nifty package that extends `ggplot2` to include animations.

* Practice **tidy evaluation** by building a few reusable functions for plotting.

I won't focus on the details of the data wrangling in this post. I recommend you watch [David Robinson's](https://twitter.com/drob) excellent [Tidy Tuesday screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyPrP_Yo1BA), where I picked up some cool tricks. One that I would like to highlight, and that I will definitely add to my toolbox, is the use of `fct_collapse` and `fct_lump` from the `forcats` package. It allows us to easily collapse several factors into manually defined groups. To see how this works, first consider the unprocessed data:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(countrycode)
library(knitr)

dir <- "/Users/sean/Documents/spacerace/"
launches_csv <- "launches.csv"
launch_data <- read_csv(paste(dir, launches_csv, sep=""))

launch_data %>% 
  count(state_code, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  kable("html")
```

The table above shows the number of launcher by nation. Some of these are actually not nations (such as I-ESA, which represents the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int/ESA)), we will deal with in a bit. Given the table above, we would like to:

1. Collapse SU (Sovjet Union) and RU (Russia) into one factor.

2. Correct the state abbreviations so that we can conveniently fetch state names using the `countrycode` package.

3. Keep the top six nations, and lump the rest into a group called `Other`.

4. Deal with missing values resulting from step 2.

The following chunk shows how to do all of the above:

```{r}
processed <- launch_data %>% 
  mutate(state_code_cleaned = fct_collapse(
    state_code,
    "RU" = c("RU", "SU"), # Collapsing SU and RU into a single factor RU
    "FR" ="F",
    "JP" = "J",
    "IT" = "I")) %>% 
  mutate(state_name = countrycode( # Using countrycode to obtain state names
    state_code_cleaned,
    "iso2c",
    "country.name")) %>% 
  mutate(state_name = fct_lump(state_name, 6)) %>% # Lumping factors not in top six into "Other"
  replace_na(list(state_name = "Other")) # Dealing with names (e.g. I-ESA) that countrycode can't handle. Since these are not in the top six we simply assign them to "Other".

processed %>% 
  count(state_name, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  kable("html")
```

Pretty cool! Anyway, on to the visualisations. Following Robinson's screencast, I ended up with the following plot:

```{r eval = FALSE}
processed %>% 
  count(state_name, launch_year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = launch_year, y = n, group = state_name)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = state_name)) +
  labs(title = "Number of yearly launches", x = "Year", y = "Launches") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

The next step was to use `gganimate` to liven things up a bit. Following the [time series example](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/wiki/Temperature-time-series) from the `gganimate` documentation, I ended up with the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
processed %>% 
  count(agency_type, launch_year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = launch_year, y = n, group = agency_type)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = agency_type), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 2020, yend = n), linetype = 2, colour = 'grey') +
  geom_point(aes(color = agency_type), show.legend = FALSE, size = 2) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 2021, color = agency_type, label = agency_type), show.legend = FALSE, hjust = 0) + 
  transition_reveal(launch_year) + 
  coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') + 
  labs(title = "Number of yearly launches", x = "Year", y = "Launches") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(5.5, 40, 5.5, 5.5))
```

Now we're talking! Next, I wanted to define a relatively general function that allowed me to use the same framework to visualise the growing influence of the private sector in space travel. I would also like the option to set a lower bound for time period I'm interested in, and I would like to be able to specify which countries I'm interested in plotting. Using tidy evaluation, I ended up with the following:

```{r}
launches_per_year <- function(df, variable, countries = c(), from.year = NA, size.margin = 50){
  
  var <- enquo(variable)
  
  if(length(countries) != 0) df <- df %>% filter(state_name %in% countries)
  if(!is.na(from.year)) df <- df %>% filter(launch_year >= from.year)
  
  p <- df %>% 
    count(!! var, launch_year) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = launch_year, y = n, group = !! var)) + 
      geom_line(aes(color = !! var)) + 
      geom_segment(aes(xend = max(launch_year), yend = n), linetype = 2, colour = 'grey') +
      geom_point(aes(color = !! var), size = 2) + 
      geom_text(aes(x = max(launch_year), color = !! var, label = !!  var), hjust = 0) + 
      transition_reveal(launch_year) + 
      coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') + 
      labs(title = "Number of yearly launches", x = "Year", y = "Launches") + 
      theme_minimal() +
      theme(plot.margin = margin(t = 5.5, b = 5.5, r = size.margin, l = 5.5),
            legend.position = "none")
  
  return(p)
}
```

Now I can call `launches_per_year` with different arguments to generate different plots. For instance, we can see how the private sector gets increasingly involved in space flight...

```{r eval = FALSE}
launches_per_year(processed, agency_type)
```

... or we could look at the same plot for the last 20 years instead.

```{r eval = FALSE}
launches_per_year(processed, agency_type, from.year = 2000)
```

Maybe we're interested in visualising how China has become a spacefaring nation to be reckoned with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
launches_per_year(processed, state_name, countries = c("United States", "Russia", "China"), from.year = 1990)
```

I was also interested in the yearly success rates of nations and agency types (public/private/startups). Again, building a relatively general function allows me to explore different options:

```{r}
learning_to_fly <- function(df, variable, names = c()){
  
  var <- enquo(variable)
  
  if(length(names) != 0) df <- df %>% filter(!! var %in% names)
  print(dim(df))
  
  p <- df %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = launch_year, y = success_rate, group = !! var)) +
    geom_line(aes(color = !! var), show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_point(aes(color = !! var, size = number_launches)) + 
    transition_reveal(launch_year) + 
    labs(title = "Yearly success rate of rocket launches", 
         x = "Year", 
         y = "Successful launches (%)",
         size = "",
         color = "") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(plot.margin = margin(t = 5.5, b = 5.5, r = 50, l = 5.5),
          legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.text = element_text(size = rel(1.1)))
  
  return(p)
}
```

For example, if I want to plot the learning curves (if you will) of the American and Sovjet/Russian space programs, I make the following function call:

```{r eval = FALSE}
learning_to_fly(success_rates, state_name, names = c("Russia", "United States"))
```

![Yearly success rate](/post/2019-01-22-first-foray-into-tidytuesday_files/p8.gif)

Note how the size of the points shrinks and expands. The size is relative to the number of launches for a given year. Also note the abrupt dip in the number of successful American launches in 1986. This is a consequence of the [Challenger disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster) on January 28, which dealt a significant blow to the US manned space program.

That concludes this week's Tidy Tuesday. Thanks for reading!
