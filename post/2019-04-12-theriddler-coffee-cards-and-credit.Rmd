Last week's [Riddler classic](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/does-your-gift-card-still-have-free-drinks-on-it/) posed the following problem:

>"You’ve won two gift cards, each loaded with 50 free drinks from your favorite coffee shop, Riddler Caffei-Nation. The cards look identical, and because you’re not one for record-keeping, you randomly pick one of the cards to pay with each time you get a drink. One day, the clerk tells you that he can’t accept the card you presented to him because it doesn’t have any drink credits left on it. **What is the probability that the other card still has free drinks on it? How many free drinks can you expect are still available?**"

# Original solution

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_condaenv("ml")
```

```{python eval=FALSE}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats


# List to keep track of credit on the other card
other_card = []
runs = 0

while runs < 500000:
    
    # Initial setup, two cards worth 50 free coffees each
    cards = {0: 50, 1: 50}
    done = False
    
    while not done:
        # Pick a card at random
        pick_card = stats.bernoulli.rvs(p=.5)
        
        if cards[pick_card] == 0:
            # If there is no credit left, check credit of other card and restart
            other_card.append(cards[1 - pick_card])
            runs += 1
            done = True
        else:
            # If there is credit left, subtract one coffee
            cards[pick_card] -= 1
            

# Plot results
other = np.array(other_card)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.distplot(other)
plt.title("Distribution of credit on other card", size=18)
plt.show()
```

```{python eval=FALSE}
# Probability that other card has free coffee left:
print(1 - np.where(other == 0, True, False).mean())
# 0.9204

# Expected number of free coffees left on other card:
print(np.mean(other))
# 7.043334
```


# Other approaches

Again, a [very elegant answer](https://www.jtash.com/riddler-gift-cards) can be found at [Jason Ash's blog](https://www.jtash.com/). He also offers a clever analytical solution to the problem. The following code is a slightly modified version Jason's implementation:

```{python eval=FALSE}
from random import randint

# List to keep track of credit on the other card
other_card = []
num_iters = 10**5

for i in range(num_iters):
    
    # Initial setup, two cards worth 50 free coffees each
    cards = [50, 50]
    
    # Pick a card at random, use until refused service
    while min(cards) > -1:
        pick_card = randint(0, 1)
        cards[pick_card] -= 1
    
    # Save remaining credit on other card
    other_card.append(max(cards))

remaining_credit = np.array(other_card)

# Probability that other card has free coffee left:
print(1 - np.where(remaining_credit == 0, True, False).mean())
# 0.92015

# Expected number of free coffees left on other card:
print(np.mean(remaining_credit))
# 7.01295
```

Reading Jason's solutions is really inspiring, both in terms of how he attacks the problems and how efficiently he implements simulations. Please [check out his site](https://www.jtash.com/) for more good stuff!
