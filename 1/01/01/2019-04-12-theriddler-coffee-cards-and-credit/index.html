<p>Last week’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/does-your-gift-card-still-have-free-drinks-on-it/">Riddler classic</a> posed the following problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You’ve won two gift cards, each loaded with 50 free drinks from your favorite coffee shop, Riddler Caffei-Nation. The cards look identical, and because you’re not one for record-keeping, you randomly pick one of the cards to pay with each time you get a drink. One day, the clerk tells you that he can’t accept the card you presented to him because it doesn’t have any drink credits left on it. <strong>What is the probability that the other card still has free drinks on it? How many free drinks can you expect are still available?</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s my attempt at a solution:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats


# List to keep track of credit on the other card
other_card = []
runs = 0

while runs &lt; 500000:
    
    # Initial setup, two cards worth 50 free coffees each
    cards = {0: 50, 1: 50}
    done = False
    
    while not done:
        # Pick a card at random
        pick_card = stats.bernoulli.rvs(p=.5)
        
        if cards[pick_card] == 0:
            # If there is no credit left, check credit of other card and restart
            other_card.append(cards[1 - pick_card])
            runs += 1
            done = True
        else:
            # If there is credit left, subtract one coffee
            cards[pick_card] -= 1
            

# Plot results
other = np.array(other_card)
sns.distplot(other)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>print(&#39;Probability that other card has free coffee left:&#39;, 1 - np.where(other == 0, True, False).mean())
print(&#39;Expected number of free coffees left on other card:&#39;, np.mean(other))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Probability that other card has free coffee left: 0.92072</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Expected number of free coffees left on other card: 7.026674</code></pre>
