      <description>This week I want to try to use purrr to model many data sets efficiently. There are many great resources available; in this post we primarily rely on the following sources:
 Managing Many Models with tidyr, purrr and broom. Purrr - tips and tricks. Many models (chapter 25 in R for Data Science).  Most of my modelling experience comes from using scikit-learn in Python. In R, the parsnip package from tidymodels seems like an extremely promising approach that I will try to explore in future posts.</description>
