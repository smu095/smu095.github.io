      <description>This week’s #tidytuesday data is the incarceration trends data set from the Vera Institute of Justice, which contains county-level jail data (1970-2015) and prison data (1983-2015). Vera is a non-profit research and policy organisation focusing on “the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, racial disparities, and the loss of public trust in law enforcement” (see the Wikipedia article for more).

      <description>This week was my Tidy Tuesday debut! Tidy Tuesday is a weekly data project which is aimed at R users who want to practice their wrangling and visualisation skills within the tidyverse. This week’s data set features a historical record of rocket launches, and formed the basis for the article “The space race is dominated by new contenders”.
My goals for this week were to:
 Expose myself to gganimate, a really nifty package that extends ggplot2 to include animations.</description>
