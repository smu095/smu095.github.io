 You have two buckets and 100 ping-pong balls, 50 of which are red and 50 of which are blue. You get to arrange the balls into the two buckets however you’d like, but each bucket needs at least one ball.</description>

      <description>Last week’s Riddler classic posed the following problem:
 “You’ve won two gift cards, each loaded with 50 free drinks from your favorite coffee shop, Riddler Caffei-Nation. The cards look identical, and because you’re not one for record-keeping, you randomly pick one of the cards to pay with each time you get a drink. One day, the clerk tells you that he can’t accept the card you presented to him because it doesn’t have any drink credits left on it.</description>

      <description>This week RStudio v1.2 was released. The newest version of the popular IDE has support for the supercool reticulate package which allows us to run Python chunks in R notebooks.
Getting started is as simple as loading reticulate and replacing the chunk ```{r} # Your R code here ``` with ```{python} # Your Python code here ```. Furthermore, reticulate has support for loading Python environments. In the example below, I access a conda environment named ml that contains all my machine learning modules.</description>
